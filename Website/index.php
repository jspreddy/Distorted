                            Have you ever seen a ghost or know someone who has. What if a ghost is nothing more than a projection of another timeline
                            that has shadowed into your world? Now combine that with the power of possession and you have Distorted. We have a house 
                            that can link two timelines forcing players to fight for survival while being possessed by a very pissed off entity.

                            Distorted is a multiplayer approach to a psychological thriller/horror that involves players that are unable to 
							see each other. Only cues from the surrounding environment and built in limited communication mechanics,
							the players must use teamwork to progress through the story.

							<p>Desmond was killed within his mansion by a mob that sought his death for many serial rapes/murders around the surrounding villages. 
							Upon his death he cursed that his work was not done and posessed the house. Every year on the anniversary of his death he 
							reawakens to exact his revenge on unsuspecting victims. Because the house is possessed by a ghost that does not seem to exist in one 
							specific timeline the day of his death happens in any iteration of time and space that the house is connected to. The two survivors attempting 
							to escape are from very distinct timelines, though the house is the same in their respective timeline.</p>
							
							<p>While the survivors are attempting to escape, the house being possessed is actively trying to kill 
							the players. The house gains strength the further apart the survivors are from each other and the survivors get distorted. When enough strength has accumulated Desmond can 
							materialize and pursue the survivors for a limited time. As the night progresses to his early morning murder he gains strength and will eventually 
							require little distance between the players to exact his revenge.</p>
